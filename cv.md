### _About myself:_

At the age of 34, I decided to change my career orientation...  

It all started when I needed a website and decided to make one myself.  

Before that, I worked as an electrician, a sales representative, and held an executive position at an enterprise.  

But none of that was as much fun for me as learning and working as a front end developer.  

My goal is to become a professional front end developer. That's why I'm studying at the **RS school**
